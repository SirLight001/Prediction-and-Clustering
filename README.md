# Prediction and Clustering: Breast Cancer Cells
The Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset is a popular medical dataset for a classification and/or clustering task. It is a life data, a multivariate with attribute character, integer. The data consists of 699 rows of observation and twelve (12) columns of variables. The first column is the sample id and the last is the classification observation for the cancer cell type. Thus, we can say that there are ten (10) number of attributes and 699 number of instances. Nine (9) of the attributes are the features which will be used as the independent variables, with 6291 observations. The nine (9) features are the characteristics of the breast cancer cell and are described in order of appearance in the data column as (a) Clump Thickness (b) Uniformity of Cell Size (c) Uniformity of Cell Shape (d) Marginal Adhesion (e) Single Epithelial Cell Size (f) Bare Nuclei (g) Bland Chromatin (h) Normal Nucleoli (i) Mitoses. The measurement of these features are scaled from 1 – 10 where value 1 is closet to Benign and 10 is closest to Malignant. The last column is the grouping variable named “class”, which categorize the cell as either “Benign” or “Malignant” with index number “2” and “4” respectively.
